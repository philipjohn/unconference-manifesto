### What is an "Unconference?"
"An unconference is a participant-driven meeting. The term "unconference" has been applied, or self-applied, to a wide range of gatherings that try to avoid one or more aspects of a conventional conference, such as fees, sponsored presentations, and top-down organization." [Wikipedia] [1]

### Why a manifesto?
There are many "facilitation styles" for an unconference-style event. This manifesto is a collaborative effort to try and provide a set of umbrella principles to aid unconference organisers and to give attendees an idea of what to expect.

## The Manifesto

An unconference *must*;

* be free
* be inclusive and non-discriminatory
* have no pre-defined agenda
* promote the [law of two feet](#two-feet)

An unconference *can*;

* have commercial sponsors
* sell stuff
* ask for donations towards costs

### <a name="two-feet"></a>The law of two feet
* You are free to enter or leave a session at any point
* You should not feel obliged to sit through a session if you decide it's not for you
* If you're running a session you should not be offended if someone leaves
