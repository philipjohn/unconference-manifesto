### What is an "Unconference?"
"An unconference is a participant-driven meeting. The term "unconference" has been applied, or self-applied, to a wide range of gatherings that try to avoid one or more aspects of a conventional conference, such as fees, sponsored presentations, and top-down organization." [Wikipedia] [1]

### Why a manifesto?
There are many "facilitation styles" for an unconference-style event. This manifesto is a collaborative effort to try and provide a set of umbrella principles to aid unconference organisers and to give attendees an idea of what to expect.
