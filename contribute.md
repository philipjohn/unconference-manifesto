As a collaborative project, you can contribute! Here's how...

1. If you don't already have one, [get a GitHub account](https://github.com/join) (don't worry, you don't need to be a coder)
1. On any page of the [Unconference Manifesto](http://philipjohn.github.io/unconference-manifesto) click the "edit this page" link
1. You can make edits right in your browser. We're using Markdown, which is like plain text with some bells and whistles. Here's a [quick guide](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics).
1. Your edits produces a "pull request" which will can then be [viewed and voted on](https://github.com/philipjohn/unconference-manifesto/pulls) by others.
1. If your change gets enough votes, it will be "merged" and the change you proposed will become part of the manifesto.

If you're familiar with Github already, you can simply [fork the repo](https://github.com/philipjohn/unconference-manifesto) and submit your pull requests.
